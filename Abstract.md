ABSTRACT
This project involves the development of a fitness tracker web application using Flutter for the front-end and Go (Golang) for the back-end. The application is designed to help users monitor and manage their physical activity, such as step count, exercise routines, and calorie intake, through a user-friendly interface. Flutterâ€™s cross-platform capabilities allow for seamless development of a responsive and engaging UI that can be accessed across various web browsers. The front-end will feature intuitive dashboards, real-time data visualization, and detailed progress tracking. Users can set fitness goals, log workouts, and receive personalized insights into their health journey.
The back-end of the application will be powered by Go, known for its efficiency and scalability, ensuring optimal performance even with a large number of users. Go will handle user authentication, data storage, and management of fitness metrics, leveraging robust RESTful APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end. Additionally, the app will incorporate real-time synchronization of data, so users can access up-to-date statistics across multiple devices. With a focus on security, performance, and scalability, this fitness tracker web app is designed to provide users with a comprehensive tool for tracking and improving their fitness goals while maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience.
